    <p>
      A mysterious elf tells Harry to expect trouble during his second year at

      cars, spiders that talk and deadly warnings written in blood on the walls
      of the school.

    <p class="movie">The Prisoner of Azbakan</p>
    <p>
      Harry learns deranged killer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban prison
      and is bent on murdering the teenage wizard. While Hermione's cat torments
      Ron's sickly rat, causing a rift among the trio, a swarm of nasty
      Dementors is sent to protect the school from Black. A mysterious new

    <p>
      There is an upcoming tournament between the three major schools of magic,
      with one participant selected from each school by the Goblet of Fire. When
      Harry's name is drawn, even though he is not eligible and is a fourth
      player, he must compete in the dangerous contest.
    </p>
    <p class="movie">The Order of Phoenix</p>
    <p>
      Now in his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry learns that many in the wizarding
      community do not know the truth of his encounter with Lord Voldemort.
      Cornelius Fudge, minister of Magic, appoints his toady, Dolores Umbridge,
      as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, for he fears that professor
      Dumbledore will take his job. But her teaching is deficient and her
      methods, cruel, so Harry prepares a group of students to defend the school
      against a rising tide of evil.
    </p>
    <p class="movie">The Half Blood Prince</p>
    <p>
      As Death Eaters wreak havoc in both Muggle and Wizard worlds, Hogwarts is
      no longer a safe haven for students. Though Harry suspects there are new
      dangers lurking within the castle walls, Dumbledore is more intent than
      ever on preparing the young wizard for the final battle with Voldemort.
      Meanwhile, teenage hormones run rampant through Hogwarts, presenting a
      different sort of danger. Love may be in the air, but tragedy looms, and
      Hogwarts may never be the same again.
